             <p id="about">Like most developers on the market, programming software came as a passion brewed over time! 
             I am an outgoing individual, a go getter. A team player who always wants to isnpire in one way or another. 
             <br> <br>I came out as the best learner in math and science in the circuit on my graduation year of high school, i was also the class president and the school's debate team leader for 3 consecutive 
             years before that. I have  1 year of programming experience and there's still room to learn a hundred folds of what i know now
             and i aim to do so. <br> <br>On my free time(when note programming haha), i spend my time with friends or family and
             have social interaction, i don't think i can classify myself as a hobby person unless listening to music or watching movies counts, everybody 
             does that right? <br> that's just about me. <br> Thank you, <a href="contact.html"> contact me</a></p>
