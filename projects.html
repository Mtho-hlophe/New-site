              <p>This is a project, i am currently working. I am using the frontend fundamental tech stack, 
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a professional banking website, where the customers 
              the bank can get service that they would normally get at physical branch. The website also enables 
              new prospects to enquire, open accounts, apply for loans, invest and do many more things just on the site
              ! Check it out, unfortunately source code is only available for potential employers.</p>

               <p>This website was purely inspired by creating a shopping cart, after seeing that it's a quite popular as 
               a portfolio project, so i decided to go a lil bit deeper, why stop there. I used javascript for the
                functionality and CSS for appearance. sorce code is on my github</p>
