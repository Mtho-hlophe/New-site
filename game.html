            <h3>Rules of the game</h3>
            <p>
                The game is made out of the hunting logic, the rabbit is being 
                hunted by three dogs. This
                game is a two player game, one player must be the rabbit, and 
                the other player be the dogs!
            </p>
            <h3>Movement rules</h3>
            <p>
                The rabbit is the first to move! <br>
                Players can move in any direction but one block at a time, and 
                a player cannot jump boxes.<br> The rabbit can slip through the dogs 
                by moving diagonally

                The dogs can only catch the Rabbit by trapping it into a corner
                whereby every movement the rabbit has is straight forward to the
                dog's block!
